> ### "WHAT IS SUCCESS?

> Laugh a lot and often; gain the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children;
> deserve the consideration of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends;
> appreciate beauty, find the best in others;
> make the world a little better, whether through a healthy child, a garden bed or a redeemed social condition;
> knowing that at least one life breathed easier because you lived it.

> This is what success means!" R.W.E

- 💞️ Using technology for this kind of success!
